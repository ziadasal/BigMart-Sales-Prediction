This repository contains the code and dataset for the BigMart Sales Prediction project. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the sales of various products in BigMart stores. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and it includes historical sales data along with information about the products and stores.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be downloaded from the following Kaggle link: [BigMart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/bigmartsalesdataset). Once downloaded, place the `bigmart.csv` file in the root directory of this project.

## Jupyter Notebook

The `BigMart_sales_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the project, including the implementation of various machine learning algorithms for sales prediction.

### Results

After thorough analysis and model development, the BigMart Sales Prediction project yielded the following key results:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values, addressing outliers, and performing feature engineering to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: A comprehensive exploration of the dataset was conducted, uncovering important insights and trends related to sales patterns, product attributes, store locations, and more. This analysis provided a deeper understanding of the factors influencing sales.

3. Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, were trained on the preprocessed data to predict sales. Each model was fine-tuned and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained models were evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict sales. Performance metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared were used to assess the models' effectiveness in capturing the underlying sales patterns.

5. Sales Predictions: The developed models were applied to make sales predictions on unseen data. The predictions provide valuable insights into future sales trends and can assist in making informed decisions regarding inventory management, pricing strategies, and promotional campaigns.

        

## Conclusion

The BigMart Sales Prediction project successfully developed and evaluated machine learning models to forecast sales in BigMart stores. By leveraging the historical sales data and attributes of the products and stores, the project provides valuable insights for optimizing business strategies and improving overall performance.
